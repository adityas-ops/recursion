# Recursion

## Definition : 

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

## Working of Recurion in c++


```c++
void recurse()
{
    ... .. ...
    recurse();
    ... .. ...
}

int main()
{
    ... .. ...
    recurse();
    ... .. ...
